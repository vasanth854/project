vendor authentication is very useful inorder to sent client request to that particular vendor. So we use JWT token
We may think vendor can be identified using their id in DB but sometimes it can be exposed so it is not a safe approch so we generate a token using vendor id using JWT.
Using const token = jwt.sign({vendorId: vendor._id}, secretKey, {expiresIn: '1h'})
